### Initial setup and planning:

1. The workshop was designed to be delivered in about 2 hours. Even with this timing some students may not be able to finish the entire workshop.
2. The workshop has been delivered to audiences of between 20 and 150 people and there are no practical limits in audience size.
3. There is about 30 minutes of lecture and presentations and the rest of the time should be devoted to having the students work through the exercises.
4. The students should not use their work AWS accounts for the labs. Ideally new accounts should be created before the workshop for each student.
5. The workshop is designed for each student to work individually but there is no reason why the students couldn't work in groups with one person driving.
